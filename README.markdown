Welcome to the yeti netbeans plugin
===================================

This is a very simple plugin for the Netbeans to code-higlight yeti files.

But code-higlighting already helps a lot :)

It is tested on Netbeans 6.8

The plugin is coded according to this nice tutorial: [http://wiki.netbeans.org/How_to_create_support_for_a_new_language](http://wiki.netbeans.org/How_to_create_support_for_a_new_language)
