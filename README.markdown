Welcome to the yeti netbeans plugin
===================================

This is a very simple plugin for the Netbeans to code-higlight yeti files and find matching braces.

That's not a lot but code-higlighting and matching braces already helps quite a bit and because it is so simple it does not always throw exceptions like 
some other much more ambitioned editors for other languages.

It is tested on Netbeans 6.8

The plugin is coded according to this nice tutorial: [http://wiki.netbeans.org/How_to_create_support_for_a_new_language](http://wiki.netbeans.org/How_to_create_support_for_a_new_language) 

## Installation

1. Download the module file `org-nbyeti-6-8-01.nbm` from the downloads section of the github project page
2. In Netbeans open the menu: `Tools / Plugins
3. In the Plugins-Dialog chose the `Downloaded` tab and press the `Add Plugins...` button and select the `org-nbyeti.nbm` you have downloaded in step 1
4. Select the `Available Plugins` tab and search for `NB Yeti` mark it and press `Install` at the bottom
5. Follow the wizard.

Now all *.yeti files should have a blue icon in the File/Projects Explorer and in the editor there should be a bit codehighlighting.
